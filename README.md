# WP Divi Starter Theme
A starter theme to build a theme using the [Divi page builder](https://www.elegantthemes.com/gallery/divi/) editor from [Elegant Themes](https://www.elegantthemes.com)

## Generate you own theme
To get started using this theme you can use the starter theme generator created for that purpose:
[Start Theme Generator](https://soda.today/wp-divi-starter-theme-generator)

## Strongly Opinionated
This starter is minimalistic but strongly opinionated. It uses [Parcel.js](https://parceljs.org/), `SCSS` and [Spectre.css](https://picturepan2.github.io/spectre/).

## Work in Progress
We are actually not happy with the state of the theme but we just wanted to start.

## SCSS Structure
The SCSS is divided into Components, Elements and Materials.
